A completly free RedM resource which creates a simple quest line. The script is fully customizable within the config.lua. The resource is simple, but my vision is to develop it furthermore in the future. It would be highly appreciated if you starred this repository and also gave me feedback and suggestions for further updates.


Watch a preview of the script [HERE](https://streamable.com/0smkfo).


#### The Script in explaination
> Via this script you can find an ped, and start a mission / quest. This quest will ask you to get to a point of the map, and deliver some packages. Then you will get asked to get back to the ped and get your reward. The mission can be cancelled any time via /endmission.
When starting a mission, a cooldown of 72000 seconds (can be changed in config) before starting another mission.

#### How to use
`Download the script`
`Run the script`
`Customize the script inside of Config.lua `


#### Dependencies
Right now this script depends on some scripts, in the future i would like to make this standalone.
QRCore
QRTarget (meta_target)
You need to have MySQL for the cooldown to work.

##### Disclaimer
This script is completely free to use. 
This script is not allowed to be sold to others in any other way. 

Any customizations from this script MUST be free to use, they cannot be sold. And they must also link to this repository.

###### Feedback / suggestions
Any feedback and suggestions is highly appreciated. Please raise them here on github issues. My plan is to further develop this script.
If you use an Redm Framework which is not working with this script, please tell me which framework so i can furthermore develop this script to support that framework.

Thanks
